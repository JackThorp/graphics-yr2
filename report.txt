Found a seamless ink-cloth texture online to add on the teapot. The texture
looks good and is generally seamless apart from the point at which the spout
joins the body of the teapot. A simple way (perhaps hacky) to improve this 
would be to manipulate the texture map so that the parts of the textue 
around the spout join are of uniform colour, light-blue in the case of this
texture.
